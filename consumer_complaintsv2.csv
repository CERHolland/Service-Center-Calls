12/11/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Shopping for a loan or lease,,"Hello, my name is XXXX XXXX, and also am writing on behalf of my grandmother, XXXX XXXX. Thank you for your time and recent assistance. I am writing for purposes of a follow up to Ford Financing/Credit, & to provide additional information, that which has evolved or occurred since the time of filing of recent complaint. 

After being rejected and originally denied through XXXX Ford & Ford Financing, naturally we were very discouraged over the issue and inability to move forward. At that point, I filed the first complaint with the CFPB. I later called the President of XXXX XXXX Ford, XXXX XXXX, and Sales Manager, XXXX XXXX to ask for further assistance with purchasing the truck. Mainly if they may be able to get an approval, good interest rate, longer term, and positive results on a XXXX application. They both were very interested and willing to try. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who I have had number of conversations with, is a person of strong integrity and has been very helpful. I have very much enjoyed meeting him. I am asking the investigation team or individuals reviewing this at Ford to make sure they speak with him directly, question him over the issue and his discussion with Financing. 

Unfortunately, there was further discrimination and an actual afront, or blocking of business on the second application. XXXX XXXX was disturbed as to the answers and responses they gave him. The application was denied for erroneous reasons, and we are still unable to purchase the truck at this point. If this discrimination continues, I am considering reporting the Financing Dept. to the US Dept. of Justice. The application was referred to a manager or supervisor, who came back and denied it. She did not want or would not allow my grandmother to purchase the truck, citing specific examples, "" because I will be the one driving it and mainly responsible for paying for it. '' This is an assumption. This also alludes to discrimination based on my grandmother 's age. It also is illegal for them to not allow her to buy it - and for anyone, especially family member, use it for any reason, as long as such purposes are legal and good. The stipulations of Ford Credit and the Federal laws regarding and surrounding purchasing of vehicles on credit, do not bar or prohibit a person purchasing a vehicle of which another family member may drive, use or participate in ownership. 

Therefore, their reasons are false, not ethical, and not based and grounded on legal reasons. They are essentially saying, no, she can not buy the vehicle because we simply do not want her to have it, and for you ( myself ) to drive it. This is the United States of America, she can legally buy any item or product she wants to or is able to, via credit or cash, if she pays for it - regardless of age or person. Period. That is US law. They clearly do not understand consumer law, customer service dynamics, how to keep good, loyal customers, or how to simply do and facilitate desirable business. They have caused us immense agrivation, time, energy and frustration. The entire financing dept. needs further classes, education and updating in these matters, so that they also reflect the highest virtues, aspirations and mission of Ford Motor Company. 

I would like to lastly say, this has become very personal in recent weeks, and it needs to stop. What they have done is wrong, unethical, not fair to the customer, has pushed away good business and people, & has caused us much personal embarassment with both dealerships. XXXX was very surprised at their responses and reasoning, & was powerless to persuade them. I encourage you to question him in a detail as to their responses and attitude. I also feel there may be some type of deeper issue at the financing dept., jealousy, disdain or other other innapropriate sentiment or perspective.

10/30/2015,Credit card,,Billing statement,,"I logged onto my Bank of America online account on XXXX XXXX and my account showed that I had a payment of {$32.00} due on XXXX XXXX. I made the payment at that time. When I logged on again on XXXX XXXX, my account showed a past due amount of {$32.00} and a late fee of {$25.00}. I verified that the payment of {$32.00} posted to my bank account on the XXXX of XXXX and called B of A. I was told that my XX/XX/XXXX statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX and that my payment of {$32.00} for XX/XX/XXXX was applied to my XX/XX/XXXX statement. After I explained that my online account showed a payment due for XXXX XXXX, the XXXX reversed the late fee and I was told that the payment would be applied to my XX/XX/XXXX statement. I checked my online account today and my statement for XX/XX/XXXX shows a late fee of {$25.00} and past due of {$32.00}, as well as credits for {$25.00} and {$32.00} ( meaning that the credits were applied to principal instead of reversing the charges ). Additionally, my minimum payment amount, which contractually should be 1 % of the outstanding balance was now {$89.00} instead of the {$32.00} is should be. This was because B of A was adding the late fee and "" past due amount '' to the minimum amount due ( {$32.00} + {$25.00} + {$32.00} = {$89.00} ). I have contacted Bank of America 's customer service multiply times and have been told that there is nothing that they can do. I feel that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for a company to tell a customer that they have a payment due and after the customer makes the payment, apply it to the previous statement cycle and increase the next minimum payment due. While the increase from {$32.00} to {$89.00} has little affect on my ability to make my payment, I 'm concerned that this practice could but some borrowers into the position of not being able to make the increased payment. If this is happening because of a timing issue between B of A 's online system and accounting system, it seems to me that it is something that B of A should correct, not an issue that should be passed on to their consumers.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",UT,846XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/30/2015,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1633450

I believe the lien in question resulted from alleged failure to pay sales tax on the purchase of a vehicle from a private owner that continued to be registered in my name without incident up until XXXX. It seems to me then that the lien should not have been there in the first place as one ca n't register and continue to register a car without having paid sales tax however as the incident took place so long ago, I no longer have any documentation to dispute it. It is my simple wish that the lien be removed from my credit report as the debt has been satisfied and misrepresents my credit worthiness to lenders- to my detriment. I can assure everyone the State of Georgia will not take my consumer report into consideration before levying a tax on me. What 's more, the amount owed in the lien was taken out of my tax returns yet again this tax season despite being satisfied, so if the lien could be construed in any way to be a reflection of my credit worthiness, it should be my ability to extend it to the State of Georgia as five months after reporting this error I have yet to see that money returned. If the consumer reporting agencies truly cared about accuracy, then they 'd mention the fact that the fine state of Georgia has brought forth an unverifiable claim of an outstanding debt six years after it was allegedly incurred and followed the act by forgetting it was satisfied one year after I paid, but I digress. I maintain simply that a 13 year old satisfied debt fails to paint an accurate depiction of my credit worthiness to lenders, and should be removed from my credit report.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/14/2016,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,2009803

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call on my home phone but did not recognize the number. I called back and found it was Portfolio Associates calling about a debt which is more than 12 years old. The debt was disputed but never resolved and since has been expunged from my credit history. I explained to the representative ( I believe her name was XXXX ) I was not going to pay the debt and instructed her to place a "" do not call '' on my account. XXXX stated she would do that. Since that time, I have continued to receive several calls a week. Many of them placed twice on the same day. I have a record in my caller ID log. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent a registered letter to XXXX XXXX, Human Resources Director. I told XXXX XXXX I did not want any further communication from Portfolio Associates ( mail or telephone ). The letter was delivered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have delivery verification. 

After the letter was received, several more calls have been placed to me. What they are doing is phoning under an ID which does not specify Portfolio Recovery. I do not answer the phone then call them back and it is Recovery Portfolio. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, at XXXX XXXX the ID listed XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke to a representative. I told her I was not to receive any more calls and she tried to argue with me but I hung up. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX the ID listed the caller as XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called back and could not understand the representative 's name. I told her I have written a letter stating I am not to be contacted in any way, shape or form. The representative looked up my account and stated there were not any notes on it saying to not call me. I explained I do not owe the debt and the representative asked if I had paid the debt with XXXX XXXX to which I replied it was irrelevant. I told the representative I filed a complaint with the FCC and what they are doing is considered harassment. She stated she would send a notice to the dispute department. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a call from XXXX, XXXX at XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative identified himself as being from Portfolio Recovery. He stated he is trying to collect an old debt and read a disclaimer stating I can be sued in court. I told him this is the 4th time I have stated I do not want any calls. Further I explained I sent a registered letter which was received. The representative stated it is not in the system. This is precisely what the representative on XXXX XXXX stated. The letter was written on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

I wish to file a formal complaint against Portfolio Recovery for harassment and threatening to sue me for a disputed debt more than 12 years old which I do not owe. I am unfamiliar with this process and would appreciate notice of how I am to proceed.

Several times they suggested that I go on financial hardship and defer my loans. XXXX XXXX did not tell me that the interest would accrue and be capitalized. Also, XXXX XXXX did not inform me that once you consolidate you ca n't ever refinance your loans - my interest rate is at 8.25 %.

11/4/2015,Credit card,,Credit determination,,"XXXX XXXX - Twice now I have submitted an application to obtain a Macy 's Department Store Credit Card and have been declined for failure to clear an initial fraud alert I have placed on my Credit Bureau. I work in the financial services industry and understand how Fraud Alerts work. I have very good credit ( XXXX score ), and should easily be able to obtain an approval for a store credit card. As a result of my good credit and in an effort to keep it that way, I have placed an initial alert on my credit report to contact me at my primary cell phone number ( home number secondarily ). 
The first time I applied ( around XXXX 2015 ), I was standing in the store and submitted and application at the point of sale. As I stood there for several minutes with my cell phone in hand waiting for a call to clear the alert, I eventually had the clerk call the credit department who informed me that I was declined because I did n't answer the phone when they called. My cell phone was in my hand the entire time and had maximum signal ( and I confirmed, they did not call my home number by mistake ). I asked them to retry and they said they ca n't - "" you get one try only ''. After arguing with them and asking to speak to a supervisor, I eventually gave up due to the line forming behind me in-store. I was told that I had to wait 30 days ( I believe ) to reapply - at the time, my frustration about the situation made me think that there is no way I would ever reapply for a Macy 's card. 
A couple months later I decided to try again, because without a Macy 's card you are forced to pay higher prices for purchases - which is a primary concern of mine here. My second attempt in XXXX 2015 was around XXXX Pacific time from my home computer. I reapplied online and had my cellphone sitting by my side the entire time, waiting for it to ring. It did n't. I soon received an email saying my application was suspended until further information could be obtained - it included a customer service number where I learned that they were only open until XXXX EASTERN time ; and therefore, I had to wait until the next day. Sometime around XXXX the next day, Macy 's credit call while I was in the shower ; no message was left, but I reverse dialed the number and confirmed it was in fact Macy 's Credit Department. I then called the customer service line and was told the same thing again - one try to clear the alert and then you 're declined. I again argued with the CSR and eventually asked to speak to a manager. XXXX ( supervisor ) came on the line and explained to me that their system prevents them from clearing an alert after the one-attempt had failed and that I could reapply in "" X '' days ( I do n't remember, I think he said 30 day ). I asked to speak to a SVP or higher, which was declined. I hung up in utter frustration. 
My concern here is that I 'm being forced to pay more for items at Macy 's because of their inflexible and unfair credit issuing practices ( generally Macy 's card holders save XXXX % on purchases ). I have great credit, a lot of disposable income and am a very responsible credit user. Macy 's practices are flawed and they need to be investigated and corrected as a result. Can you please let me know what you can do for me ( and countless others ) in this situation? I question the entire industry practice of discounting for Store Card holders if they 're not going to apply fair lending practices. 
Thank you XXXX XXXX, I look forward to the CFPB 's response.

3/11/2017,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),Credit decision / Underwriting,,"On XX/XX/2016, we accepted an offer from CitiMortgage to refinance the adjustable-rate mortgage we had with them, paying an application fee and locking in a 15-year, fixed-rate of 2.875 %. From the outset, we emphasized that the bulk of our living expenses are funded by automatic monthly withdrawals from our retirement accounts ( IRA, SEP-IRA and a tax-deferred employee savings plan ), in addition to our investment portfolio. 

After five months and countless hours of complying with Citi 's requirements for documentation -- often being asked for the same documents two or three times over -- we have been informed that our application has been denied due to "" Insufficient income for mortgage obligations. '' This is despite our repeated documentation of over ample funds in our retirement accounts and steady monthly withdrawals. 

Citi 's underwriting department required : "" If income is from retirement assets provide 2 months current, complete and consecutive bank statements to verify sufficient assets for income to continue for 3 years. '' Accordingly, we provided copies of our XXXX statements reflecting our retirement accounts and our bank statements -- several times. At no time did Citi ask for additional information about any of our retirement accounts, even though we offered. In the last communication from the loan processor, she stated that they had enough information to submit the package to underwriting. 

Our cash flow is more than ample to meet our mortgage obligations and living expenses. Citi has known this from the beginning, but continued to string us along and repeatedly asked for the same documents until finally after -- five months -- they declared that our income was insufficient. It is now clear that Citi simply did n't want to refinance the loan in the face of rising interest rates, and continued to mislead and deceive us. We have retained all correspondence and documentation.

I called back to the National Recovery unit and offered to pay the collection if they could immediately send me confirmation via Fax or Email that I had paid the debt. They indicated they would not be able to send me confirmation of debt payment immediately and I would instead need to send them a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a receipt of payment. My account number for the collection was XXXX and my confirmation of payment is XXXX. These practices cause consumer harm. Not having received written notice does not give the consumer the opportunity to dispute a collection prior to it showing up on a credit bureau and then not allowing customers to immediate proof of payment on a collection can result in them having a higher interest rate on loans. A consumer has the most rights to their own information and with today 's technology collection agencies should be required to provide an immediate receipt to customers.

2/11/2017,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"To begin, my previous dispute with the Consumer Protection Bureau against Transunion was not properly addressed. Originally, I demanded validation from the following creditors : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to prove the amount they seek to collect is valid. They have not provided any evidence or information to me to substantiate their demand for payment. Transunion did not provide an explanation of how they verified the creditor has complied with my validation request to allow them to continue reporting the information. All Transunion has done is describe how TransUnion verified the balance due. Pursuant of the Fair Credit Reporting Act I request a detailed description of the method used to verify the creditor 's compliance with MY DEBT VALIDATION REQUEST. 

Although, it is not Tranunion 's obligation to mitigate disputes between consumers and data furnishers, it is Tranunion 's obligation to ensure the data furnishers are following the laws which govern credit reporting and collection. I understand you are not obligated to acquire original documents to verify the information, however ; the creditor can not report information that they can not validate to me, the consumer, after I have requested it. This letter is advising you that the company has not complied with my demand for validation. It is now your obligation to verify their compliance with my debt validation request prior to the continuation of reporting their furnished information. 

Ultimately, I need the invalid information removed from my reports immediately as it is causing financial harm. I own and operate a conglomerate that focuses on the acquisition of well performing small businesses and this inaccurate information is preventing me from obtaining necessary loans for me to earn a living. If you continue to report information that the company has not validated with me, I will pursue legal action in the XXXX County Court of Nebraska. I will seek lost earnings in the amount of {$2100.00} per week which is what this invalid information is costing me. In addition to the actual damages, I will seek statutory damages for every unverified and invalid item you continue to report. Finally, I will seek recoupment of any and all legal fees I acquire to enforce the Fair Credit Reporting Act with your company.

I was told an investigation would be opened and I would be sent an update in writing. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX and not only have I not received any information in writing regarding this investigation, I now see multiple new charges from the same vendors on the card. I had paid my last statement balance in full ( including disputed charges ) on XX/XX/XXXX since I had not heard from Capital One and did not want to be assessed late fees or penalties. 

Capital One now informs me that it will take 1-2 billing cycles to resolve the fraudulent claims and that in the interim they will not issue credits. So due to the lack of efficiency of Capital One, the consumer, has to pay unauthorized charges. Not only that, despite me having flagged unauthorized charges from vendors, they continued to authorize charges from these same vendors despite the card number having being changed. The explanation for this is that XXXX has updated the vendor with the new card number. So, to sum up, despite me flagging a vendor as having made unauthorized charges on my account, Capital One has seen fit to go ahead and without my permission update the vendor with my new card number and then had the gall to actually authorize further charges on the card. 

This is a travesty of consumer rights. I did not give Capital One any permission to update vendors when my card number changes. In fact, I want quite the opposite. Why is this being done?

In XXXX, I was working as a XXXX. It was decided that I would get a separate checking account from my wife. As I was out of town working, she went to XXXX XXXX and opened the account for me. Her name was not on the checks. She did not have an ATM. She did not put money into this account, or take money from this account. It was my account alone, or so I thought. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I had an overdraft protection account with Wells Fargo. I went to transfer funds from this account and found it was closed. I went to the XXXX Wells Fargo branch and talked with the banker. He said that my wife had a loan that was overdue so they closed my overdraft account. I asked about her loan and he said that he could not tell me about it as my name was not on the loan. I asked why they had closed my account and he said that her name was on this checking account. I told him that was wrong, this was my account alone. He said since she originally started the paperwork on this account, her name was on the account. I asked him to remover her name, he said that I could not do that, she had to. I talked with my wife and she went to Wells Fargo to have her name removed. I paid the money I owed on the overdraft account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my payroll check for {$1200.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my online Wells Fargo account to pay bills. It showed that {$1200.00} was withdrawn from my account showing "" PCM offset ''. I went to the Wells Fargo branch to ascertain what had occurred. The banker told me that he could not tell me, but alluded that it had to do with my wife being on my account. I told him that she had been removed from the account XX/XX/XXXX. He said that, no she was still listed on the account. I went and picked up my wife and we returned. I was told that she had an account that was in arrears and they had taken my payroll check. My wife showed that she was paying on this account that was in arrears. She had made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. He said that there was nothing he could do. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, this banker said that he tried to get the money refunded but they refused. 
I have had this account since XX/XX/XXXX. I pay all my bills with Wells Fargo and other creditors. Had I known this money was owed, I would have worked to correct the problem. I strongly resent that they arbitrarily seized my payroll check. 
I would like this money refunded to me. I have bills of my own that I planned to pay with this money. I never authorized this withdraw or had any knowledge of a debt.

Vacated the property on XXXX XXXX - started receiving letters months later from Hunter Warfield that I owed in excess of {$3600.00} after my {$1000.00} security deposit was applied. I never received written notice from landlord stating my rights as a tenant to contest charges. I have repeatedly asked for invoices as to the damage and have been hung up on, harassed when I am working and am badgered with lawsuits, being told I have to get an attorney and that my credit will be wrecked if I do not pay. No one is willing to verify that this debt is accurate and when asked for copies of invoices I am told to get an attorney. I am a XXXX year old XXXX XXXX student supporting my way and do not have the luxury of an attorney. XXXX Statutes mandate that I am to be sent a written letter explaining the charges, the reasoning my security deposit is held and my rights to dispute and I have never received anything like that. I am told that they have photo 's, but I have photo 's date and time stamped as well proving many of the charges were falsified. I was told also that the leasing company is too big to provide the invoices so I should get an attorney just to verify that these charges are accurate. The charges were reported the day I vacated the property - how a house can have drywall, painting, cleaning all in the same day I moved out is ridiculous. The removal of items that they are claiming as well charging me for, are in my friends garage so obviously the leasing company went to our house prior to our move out. These charges make no sense, I was never officially notified by the leasing company and the debt collectors Hunter Warfield have no proof that the debt is even accurate but are putting on my credit report. The only proof of any letter sent by leasing company was to my former roommate. There is nothing showing my name.

'' XX/XX/XXXX, I terminated my cellphone contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX and switched over to XXXX. I carried out the process at a local XXXX store, under the guidance of an inept XXXX representative who did not complete the "" contract buy out '' process correctly, and misrepresented that any remaining balance would be taken care of, as well. This resulted in my owing substantial fee 's relating unsatisfied cellphone financing. 

The problem is that XXXX XXXX XXXX never reached out to me during the last ten months to inform me that I owed them money. They did not use any medium, whatsoever - neither telephone, text message, email, nor physical mail. Nothing. By chance, I decided to check my credit report because I am in the process of seeking a new apartment. Suddenly, there was a derogatory mark showing {$850.00} in collections, posted by Diversified Consultants, Inc., originating from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out about the source of this debt, as I was totally clueless. XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that it related to the phone financing balance when I terminated my relationship. They also informed me that the account was transferred to Diversified in XXXX XXXX. I was receiving calls from a mysterious number, but whenever I answered the phone and said "" hello '' multiple times - at least 6 or 7 times - no one was on the other end of the line. Therefore, I assumed that it was either a scam caller, a sales call, some sort of political canvasser, or maybe an ex-boyfriend. I honestly had no reason to know that I owed money to anyone, and due to this company 's bizarre delay in coming onto the line, I was still unable to recognize that I owed AT & T anything. 

I corresponded with the XXXX Contract Buy Out Department and they agreed to send me XXXX cards to pay the financing charges, despite the lapse in time. The headache is that Diversified told me that they will only mark the account as satisfied and will not remove the notation. XXXX XXXX XXXX also has a laissez-faire attitude about screwing up my credit. I previously had a XXXX credit score, and because of the incompetence of these totally irresponsible and unprofessional institutions, I have to bear the brunt. This is absolutely disgusting. I work so hard at being a financially responsible millennial, and the odds are, apparently, stacked against me. I can do everything right, pay everyone on time, pay them more than the minimum, and a big institution can just randomly take a dump on my reputation. Now when I apply to apartments, my candidacy will be compromised by the negligence of others. I have no problem with being held accountable for my own choices, but it is so appalling that I should be penalized over the mistake and oversight of others. 

In conclusion, I would like to know if there is anyway that I can have this notation EXPUNGED from my report after I receive my XXXX cards ( in 15 days ) and satisfy the balance.

I originally started with XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. A couple of months later, my phone was stolen and since I did n't purchase insurance, I had to wait a couple of months to purchase a new phone. When I called XXXX to activate the new phone, the representative said that given my situation she felt I would be better off switching to a pre-paid plan. I was concerned about being charged an early termination fee, but she assured me that as long as I stayed with XXXX for the duration of the original contract, I would n't be charged a termination fee. I took her advice and did as she suggested. I remained a loyal XXXX pre-paid customer through XX/XX/XXXX. 

A look at my credit report lead me to find that they charged me a termination fee even though the XXXX representative said they would n't. I found that they sent it to a collections agency ( Enhanced Recovery Company ). I 've spoken to representatives at Enhanced Recovery, who told me to get XXXX to send this information. In XXXX and in XXXX XXXX different XXXX supervisors acknowledged their mistake, and promised that their XXXX Team would contact me so I could get this information to Enhanced Recovery, and get it off my credit report. Their XXXX XXXX failed to contact me both times, but this time I recorded the conversation with them. In this recording ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the Supervisor acknowledges that the previous Supervisor ( from our XXXX conversation ) sent a letter to their XXXX Team indicating that I should NOT have been charged and early termination fee because their Representative did not enter such fee into my new agreement. 

I 've sent letters to both XXXX and Enhance Recovery Company, but nothing has been done to clear up my credit. I 'm a XXXX veteran who really needs help getting this problem fixed. Please help me.

1/16/2017,Credit card,,Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,,"I am currently visiting XXXX, XXXX from XXXX. 
I had a XXXX account that had XXXX different credit cards linked to it. On XX/XX/2016 ( XXXX ), I awoke to find a number of XXXX charges ( {$50.00} gift cards, {$75.00} reloadable charges ) on one of my statements, posted XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ). I logged into my XXXX account and saw that they had done that to my other card, as well. Since the 3rd was a prepaid card and had no balance, it was not affected. So we will call them Card XXXX and Card XXXX, for simplicity. 
I submitted a fraud complaint to XXXX and they reversed the charges for Card XXXX, recognizing that it was fraudulent activity ( they could see the balance from each gift card in the account transferring to gift cards outside of the account, a sign that money was going out and to a third party individual ). They offered to be to reverse charges for Card XXXX also, but that I should contact my card companies as well because the hacker may have information about these cards. I decided to let Card XXXX company ( BarclayCardUS ) handle it. 
So I contacted Card XXXX company and they canceled the card and resent a new one. All good. I contacted Card XXXX ( BarclayCardUS ) via XXXX using credits on XX/XX/2016. The gentleman told me he would cancel my credit card altogether, submit the case to the fraud department and they would resolve. 
I checked my account on XX/XX/2016 and all of the XXXX charges had been reversed for the BarclayCardUS account -- -- - except for XXXX. I called back and the representative said that everything was fine, however they can not credit the last charge back to the card because the card is canceled : they need to wait for a new card to be issued, transfer the balance, then credit the {$75.00} back. They "" inadvertently '' canceled the card before removing all of the charges. OK, that 's fine ... I can understand mistakes like these. I also sent a message ( see attached transcript ) and received a response that it would be resolved. 
Over the course of the last two months, the charge has not been resolved. Although BarclayCardUS insisted I am not responsible for the late fee charge or interest gained while they wait for the the balance to transfer and fix the charge, I am worried it could negatively impact credit score- and frankly, two months to resolve this is quite a long time, especially when their message says "" maximum 30 days ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response asking for an addition "" XXXX 10 business days '' to address the problem. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX and she asked for an additional XXXX10 business day extension. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, after I requested a status update on the case, they claim that their fraud department has spoken with XXXX again and BarclayCardUS decided it is not fraud and have labeled it as merchant dispute as of XX/XX/XXXX. They messaged me and are now wanting me to contact them by phone, speak with managers, and ultimately compile documentation from XXXX and post it from overseas to prove it was fraud. 
1 ) I am not sure how I can independently verify with XXXX that the charges were fraudulent, but their fraud department can not. That seems incredulous. 
2 ) I am not sure why it was so easy to have XXXX reverse the charges for Card XXXX and also for me to cancel Card XXXX with the respective company ... however BarclayCardUS resolves all but XXXX charge and now has a new, different story two months afterward.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,SC,295XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/16/2017,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2292729

5/13/2016,Debt collection,Credit card,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"In XXXX or around there my wife and I started XXXX XXXX XXXX with my brother and sister in law XXXX in XXXX of XXXX we opened a credit line with XXXX credit cards. In XXXX of XXXX we were bought out by the XXXX and any past and future debt we were to be indemnified. A buyout contract was drafted and signed XXXX XXXX, XXXX. A few weeks ago ( 8+years later ) I am getting phone calls from debt collectors at BBT saying that I owe b/c I am listed as a guarantor on the card and it is over 60 days late. I reached out to BB & T eventually talking to XXXX XXXX ( VP Small Business ). He asked if I had removed myself and I told him I could n't remember something 8 years ago, but I thought I had or the XXXX were supposed to. I sent him a copy of the buyout contract, but ultimately he said I was liable b/c my name was on the sheet and that it was up to me to make sure I was removed. I asked him repeatedly why my wife was n't getting calls for collection since she was a guarantor on their as well. He said he did n't know, but assured me the XXXX were. Yesterday we spoke to XXXX XXXX who is the person who opened the account for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I coming in and her closing XXXX XXXX account, but said it is most likely her fault for not closing mine. There is no way my wife and I would n't have gone in together and removed XXXX our names from this credit line. Furthermore XXXX claims she told XXXX XXXX all of this, but he still would not release me and lied to me saying he did n't know why my wife XXXX XXXX XXXX was being called. She is not being called b/c she is not on the account any longer! I am being told that the past due delinquency is almost 90 days at which time the debt will be handed off to a collections agency and it will hit my credit. My credit score right now is a perfect XXXX. 
I should not be responsible for someone elses debt. There is evidence that supports us being bought out in late XXXX and there is a person who remembers closing my wife 's account and saying she may be at fault for not removing myself. XXXX XXXX claimed he moved up to his superiors to plead my case with no success, but yet lied to me about my wife being on the account so I ca n't know for certain that he went to his superiors. I am not sure what is going on, but I should n't have to pay someone elses debt nor should my credit take a hit for something I did n't do. XXXX said that this debt will probably be handed over to collections in the next week or so and at that time hit my credit. So with that info I am being forced to consider paying a monthly payment of a debt thats not mine to bide me time on my credit to refi my house. I threatened to take my mortgage and over XXXX accounts from BB & T with no effect, but I have started that process either way this turns out. I am being told by some that technically the bank can attach to other accounts so I am moving to not take that chance as well as I do n't want to do business with a bank that knowingly treats their customers this way. My move has to be done before my credit tanks. 

I have told XXXX that I did n't know my name was on their. I have never received a statement in over 8 years. He asked if it was on my online banking and I said no. He went on while we were on the phone and verified that it was n't. I also told him it did n't appear on my credit report which I receive monthly. 

I have limited time here. I do n't have the money to pay a minimum payment and should n't have to, but to move my mortgage I am being forced to do so. 

I almost conceded to just take the hit on my credit b/c morally I was n't going to pay the debt and BB & T was still holding me liable, but with this new evidence of XXXX XXXX I will not succumb to the big bank treating my family and I this way.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BB&T CORPORATION,NC,278XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/13/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1925428

10/29/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"My credit was affected by the poor business practices of LoanCare, the mortgage loan servicer for XXXX Mortgage. Below is a brief summary of the most recent incident. LoanCare systemically engages in obstructive, if not downright fraudulent, business practices, resulting in late payment fees and negative impacts on credit scores. I have paid our mortgage without fail every month since we bought our home XX/XX/XXXX 
Monthly, we pay our mortgage by scheduling online payments through our XXXX Bank checking account. At some point, LoanCare changed our mortgage account number ( without notifying me XXXX, resulting in the XX/XX/XXXX payment being returned electronically to our XXXX Bank account XX/XX/XXXX. LoanCare did n't notify me that this payment was returned, so I thought our mortgage payments were being applied appropriately. Instead, the account appeared to be missing the payment XX/XX/XXXX. Further, the amount of the monthly mortgage payment increased over the summer from {$2600.00} to {$2700.00} ( also without me being notified ), so not only were subsequent mortgage payments being applied to each previous month 's mortgage, I also then needed to pay the difference in the new monthly amount as well as late fees to rectify this. Because the monthly loan amount increased, and LoanCare wo n't apply payments unless they cover the entire monthly amount due, LoanCare then held {$2500.00} without applying it to my account, thus charging me further late fees. LoanCare did not have the correct mailing address or contact phone number listed on my account, and had my wife 's phone number listed as the contact, even though she is not on the mortgage. After spending much time talking to various call center employees and supervisors to figure out why LoanCare was n't accepting my mortgage payments, I paid ( again ) the mortgage payment that was returned XX/XX/XXXX, as well as the difference remaining after the monthly mortgage amount was increased, plus late fees of {$430.00}. I asked LoanCare, ( in writing : XXXXXXXXXXXX ), for these late fees to be refunded and a letter sent to the credit report agencies stating that my account is paid as agreed with no late payments. I also updated ( again ) our mailing address and contact info, and asked that I be immediately notified if there are any subsequent changes to the account. After waiting several months for a reply, LoanCare stated that they would not refund late fees and would not send a letter to the credit reporting agencies showing that my account has always been continuously paid in full, on time.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"LoanCare, LLC",UT,840XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/29/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1631620

The caller requested that I send the money via Walmart money-gram transfer. The caller specified that the funds should be sent in XXXX phases : XXXX for {$1000.00} and the other for {$850.00} and that each should be sent from XXXX different Walmart locations. 
The caller also requested that I keep the winnings secret from everybody so that others will not harass me for a share of the winnings. 
As I became more skeptical of the prize, I requested that the caller provide me with written confirmation of my prize. The caller then e-mailed me what appeared to be valid documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating that I had in fact won a prize. 
Based upon that information, I wired the first {$1000.00} to the caller in XXXX. I attempted to wire the second portion for {$850.00}, but the employees at Walmart strongly recommended that I not send the money. I complied with their advice and did not send the second installment. 
When I informed the caller ( "" XXXX XXXX '' ) he became angry with me and informed me that I should have told the employees at Walmart that the reason for the transfer was none of their business and that I should have insisted on them completing the transfer. "" XXXX XXXX '' informed me that without the advance payment on the taxes owed, I could not hope to collect my prize of {$2.00} XXXX. 
I also noted that the "" documentation '' e-mailed to me indicated that the taxes due would be {$25000.00} USD. 
I subsequently sought the opinion of my tax advisor on this matter. He reviewed my documentation and recollection of events and informed that it was his opinion that I was the victim of fraud. 
The next day, the caller, "" XXXX XXXX '' called to inform me that I would need to transfer, bank-to-bank, {$25000.00} to complete the required advancement of the taxes owed. 
When I informed my tax advisor of this new request, he stated that he would like to be present when "" XXXX XXXX '' telephoned.

On the second call, I answered and XXXX XXXX wanted to know if anyone else was present. I informed him that my tax advisor was present with me. When my tax advisor confronted XXXX XXXX about the fraud, XXXX XXXX became angry and demanded to know my tax advisor 's name and stated that he would come over and have him fired from his job.

1/8/2017,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"In XXXX 2016, I contacted my current mortgage company, PennyMac USA to refinance my condo. While they warned me that it would take 6 weeks to get an appraisal due to the real estate market in my city, they assured me it would take no longer than that. I was upfront with the lender that I was temporarily working away from my primary residence for another 3 months. I still considered the residence my primary home - I was traveling extensively for work, did not establish another residence, and was not paying rent on another unit. I explained that while I was away, my mail was being forwarded to a family member 's home to ensure that it was being received and taken care of timely. Over the course of almost the entire process, I was told that this would not be an issue. 

After two and a half months, at the end of XXXX 2016, an appraisal had still not been completed, and I was informed at that point that the underwriter wanted statements verifying why my mail was going to another location, including submitting utility statements. Because my HOA handled almost all of the utilities, the only utility that I would have paid for was on a freeze. I reactivated the service, and submitted proof to the mortgage company. At this point, I was also required to submit even more documentation, such as my XXXX and income documents for a third or fourth time, as well as updated paystubs and bank statements ( putting the total information they had on me at more than six months ). I was ensured that this would be the last batch of information that they needed, and that as soon as the appraisal had been completed, the refinance would be approved and processed. 

The appraisal was finally ordered, which took almost two weeks for completion. At that point, I was told I needed to submit updated bank statements again, to prove that I had an arbitrary amount of money on hand. I was never told why that number was important, or how it was calculated. Unfortunately, because of the timing of the bank statements, no new statements were available to provide since the end of XXXX 2016. While I was told that would n't be an issue, less than a week later, I was told that the underwriter would not be approving my refinance because she did n't feel that there was sufficient documentation or explanation to prove that this was n't my primary residence. I offered to submit written statements from family members and any documentation that I might have from my job, but I was ignored and the file was closed out. I never heard back from the underwriter, and it took almost two weeks for the loan officer to inform me by phone that the refinance had been rejected. 

The entire process was disastrous and a disgrace. The mortgage company took far too long to review the case, and if they had done so in a timely manner, I would have been able to provide any documentation they requested to show that I traveled extensively for work. At best, the loan officers and processors had placed my file on the backburner, figuring that the appraisal would n't be done for a while, and at worst, they lied to me and purposefully refused to respond to me about the status of the loan. 

PennyMac USA essentially promised me that this refinance would be approved, as well as the financial benefits that would come along with it, such as having the current escrow account closed out and having the first payment pushed back by one month. Because of that, and other changes in my circumstances, PennyMac USA has dealt me a significant financial blow. At this exact moment, I am unable to pursue a refinance with another lender, and even if I were able to do so, the rates have changed significantly - putting the 30-year refinance at anywhere from .25 % to .5 % higher than the rate I was offered.",,"PENNYMAC LOAN SERVICES, LLC.",OR,986XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/8/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2279748

6/21/2016,Money transfers,International money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"I found a snow mobile that I was interested in, which was located in XXXX, a city located in XXXX. I contacted the seller of the snow mobile and we exchanged conversation over the next week or so about the product, and purchasing it. The seller wanted me to wire him the money ( {$5000.00} ) but I did not feel safe buying something in another country by just wiring funds. I requested him to send me an invoice via PayPal as I assumed that PayPal was the safest way to make the payment in the event there was issues I would be protected and can easily file a dispute with PayPal to be protected. He was n't happy with receiving PayPal as a form of payment, but he did send me an invoice of {$5200.00} as I instructed him to so that he has the additional {$200.00} to cover the fees that PayPal will charge to receive the funds. 
After sending payment, I proceeded with trying to schedule my drive out to XXXX to pick up the snow mobile. Being a XXXX hour drive ( each way ) from XXXX OH where I am from, I wanted to ensure everything was in order for the long trip. 
He had told me the town he resided in, but never the exact address. I asked him numerous times, and his response was 'just head up here, I 'll give it to you when you are close '. I did not want to drive XXXX hours to not have an address of where to go to, especially crossing the border incase I was questioned for the drive when pulling a trailer. Within an hour of starting the drive, and insisting I received an actual address, the seller then stated that he either needed more money for the snow mobile due to PayPal fees ( which was incorrect ) or that he needed cash instead. Having already sent him the {$5200.00} which was already deducted from my account, and being a weekend, I was n't able to go and withdraw another {$5000.00}, especially since he had not refunded me the original payment. If he wanted me to bring cash, he could have easily refunded the payment, and I would have been able to reschedule the trip and bring actual cash if necessary. 
Since we did not come to terms on the purchase, I decided to turn back around and head home. 
Once I returned I asked him to issue a refund, which he ignored. I asked numerous time, stating that I would file a dispute with PayPal if he had not refunded me, which he also ignored. 
I file a dispute, later escalating it to a claim. The seller attached a tracking number in his answer to the dispute filed, and upon receiving the box that he had sent and attached a tracking number of in PayPal, the contents of the box were as follows : ( picture of box and contents also included in evidence pictures herein ) XXXX XXXX, bag of XXXX chips, hand cream, toy XXXX wheeler, picture of the sled being purchased inside XXXX XXXX, and disinfectant wipes. 
The claim got turned down via PayPal as they stated that this has to do with the purchase of a 'motor vehicle ' and they do not govern, not does a purchase of such fall under their buyer protection terms. 
I have filed a Police Report with my local Enforcement Agency, as well as made a Claim to the Ohio Attorney Generals Office. That claim number with the Attorney Generals Office is XXXX, filed on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 
I wish to file the claim here as this is absolutely a form of fraud this individual has committed, as well as to prevent him from doing so in the future as he seems like someone who will again and again after what seems like he is getting away with quite easily. 
Documentation being provided includes, full conversation via text message as a PDF file, Police report filed with local agency, copy of initial money transfer via PayPal, and pictures of box and its contents as received from the seller.",,PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC.,OH,441XX,,Consent provided,Web,6/21/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1977372

10/13/2015,Credit card,,Billing disputes,,"This is a follow-up complaint for a recent complaint I filed in case number XXXX. Rather than start a new complaint, I 'll explain additional details under this case number. 
Today ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) I received a letter from Synchrony Bank concerning a credit due to my credit card account ending in XXXX. The letter states that "" According to our records, your credit of {$960.00} was applied to your account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. You can find this credit on a previous billing statement. '' The letter was sent from the Customer Service Department. Having all my previous statements in hand, I know the above quote from the letter is patently false. 
I called Customer Service yet again today to ask them to explain the letter and point me to the statement that contained the applied credit. I spoke with customer rep "" XXXX '' who told me that the letter was not in error-that it referred to when I opened the dispute. Clearly the letter says nothing of the sort. She absolutely would not concede that the letter was in error in stating that the credit was applied to my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
Noting it was clearly futile to argue the point, it is clear to me that this is an effort to XXXX on the part of Synchrony Bank in anticipating a complaint investigation. I highly resent these tactics, given the time and consternation this has caused me in this matter. A simple "" mea culpa '' admission and correcting the matter would suffice. However, to prolong such a matter in this way is despicable. 
I want to make this matter a part of my complaint and keep the record factual. I 'm attaching a copy of the letter for the record.",,SYNCHRONY BANK,GA,301XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/13/2015,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1603376
6/6/2016,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Account terms,XXXX posted on my credit report {$1300.00}. I spoke with the collection agency XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2015 to settle my account. XXXX XXXX offered me a settlement of {$790.00} which includes two payments of {$390.00} to be ACH from my checking account per XXXX XXXX. One payment of {$390.00} was deducted from my account XXXX/XXXX/2015. the remaining payment of {$390.00} was supposed to be deducted by ACH as well on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Payment was not deducted. I called XXXX XXXX and received only voicemail each time. XXXX decided to send my account to another collection agency ( XXXX ) to come after me for the remaining balance of {$910.00}. Credence posted immediately on my Experian credit report {$910.00} after sending me an offer settlement of {$850.00}. ( in which i had already settled with XXXX XXXX ). I forwarded XXXX the attached documents that a settlement and payment was made through XXXX XXXX and another was supposed to have been made on XXXX/XXXX/2015. XXXX asked that i forward the information to the email they provided me. I did and now they are requesting the additional payment that should have been made in XX/XX/XXXX in order for them to remove the incorrect balance off my credit report of {$910.00}.

1/11/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"I applied for {$220000.00} to refinance my mortgage with Quicken XXXX XXXX with the promise that as a current Quicken customer, I would have NO CLOSING COST. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the Closing Care Rep. ( CCR ) called to review my Closing Disclosure and scheduled closing for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The rate was 3.75 %, when we agreed on 3.5 %. After questioning the rate change, I was referred back to the Mortgage Banker ( MB ) for an explanation. It was corrected to 3.5 %, which somehow increased my closing cost by {$190.00}. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the CCR called to review my updated Closing Disclosure and confirm my closing for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The figures on the closing documents were substantially different from the Closing Disclosure we reviewed upon scheduling the closing. Again, I was referred back to the MB for an explanation as to why the figures changed. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a new Closing Disclosure was prepared for closing set for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Upon viewing the document, closing cost increased by more than {$4600.00}. I questioned the CCR as to why the figures changed and once again was referred back to the MB. The explanation was that my house appraised for a different amount ( {$350000.00} ) than I originally stated ( {$300000.00} ). Immediately I questioned if I was being penalized for Quicken being placed in a better position with a lower LTV from 73 % to 63 %. He explained that they have applied the max lender credit of {$5500.00} and that was all they could do. Once I pointed out that they originally offered {$5700.00}, he stated he would have his director send me a {$200.00} check outside of closing but the numbers WOULD NOT BE CHANGED back to the Closing Disclosure dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He admitted that he did n't know why the numbers changed. I thanked him for being honest in not trying to justify the mistake and of course for the {$200.00}. I then requested the closing be cancelled. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the CCR called back to explain my figures changed due to interest on my payoffs. From XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX my interest increased by {$5000.00}? The interest on my mortgage with Quicken is around {$400.00} each month. Over a 10 day period, {$5000.00} of accrued interest was not sensible. Again, he would have my MB contact me to explain. No one called. 
Therefore on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called the MB who explained, "" This is bare-bone and nothing else we can do. '' He offered to have his Director call me. The question remains, WHY DID THE FIGURES CHANGE? 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a Director of Mortgage Banking called to explain that as of XXXX XXXX, new TRID guidelines state that "" Once something is disclosed it CAN NOT be changed ''. He also stated that "" the Federal Government wo n't let us close absorbing that much cost ''. I asked what XXXX stood for and he could n't remember. I immediately told him that I 'm the type of customer that will research XXXX on my own. He stated he would talk to someone about an offer that would be better than I was originally quoted. For clarity, I explained that in order for something to be better, it must beat the closing Disclosure dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. If not, we can stop this back and forth. 
In researching XXXX, it clearly states that there are XXXX circumstances that REQUIRE a new Closing Disclosure and 3-day review period. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, a Solutions Team rep called to discuss my desired outcome. Again I requested an explanation as to WHY DID THE FIGURES CHANGE? He noticed I was deceitfully charged 1/4 % each time for two rate lock extensions that were never mentioned to me. I NEVER REQUESTED AN EXTENSION. The extensions were granted on Quickens behalf because the closing documents did n't match Disclosure XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He stated, "" The problem is that we gave you the best deal w/no cushion in case something went wrong ; something DID go wrong and we do n't have a cushion to work with. '' Why am I being penalized for undisclosed rate lock extensions due to inconsistencies with the original closing documents?",,"QUICKEN LOANS, INC.",NC,283XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/11/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1735580

I had no issues with my bank nor did I believe I had any issues with any of the credit Bureaus. I had just check my credit score and report with Equifax at home on my computer. My credit score was showing at XXXX all of my accounts were in good standing paid as agreed in addition any credit cards and loan balances only ( XXXX ) accounts I had balances on all paid down less than half of what was owing on each account. In addition I had no negative, late or derogatory information on my account for over the past 7 years or more. However when the credit report was returned to the bank. It stated that my credit score was at a XXXX and I had filed a bankruptcy. My request for a loan was denied. 

This action on behalf of Equifax was an act to retaliate ( hit back ) in addition to abuse of power in response to all the complaints and disputes I filed against the company in the past .Doing what is stated by law file a complaint when there is mis-leading, inaccurate or false information on my report I called Equifax and talked to a supervisors XXXX XXXX she told me that at the time the request was submitted I did not have anything on my report she did inform me that for the last past 6 years although it was showing on my physical report all my accounts were in good standing however in the status code section of the report the XXXX XXXX XXXX account was reporting as an XXXX which means an mortgage account in collections. When I asked how can I get the information they sent to the bank corrected, XXXX XXXX said they would send an updated report to the bank. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX afterward and explain what I had been told. I was asked to call Equifax back and find out which department would the report go to. I called XXXX XXXX back but after more than a week of receiving no return phone calls ( the receptionist informed me that she was in the office and not on vacation. ) I was sent to the customer service department. 

When the customer service department answer the phone, the clerk told me I was to have the person at the bank call the phone number she gave me and they would send the bank an updated report with the correct credit score and information. She also informed me that the current status on the XXXX account was showing M- Bankruptcy. She told me she would file a dispute and although XXXX from the bank called and requested a new credit report, One was never sent.

8/15/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Using a debit or ATM card,,"I currently work for an XXXX. Months ago my card was hacked and it took almost two months for regions to rectify the situation. They sent me letters that miscalculated the costs which led me to believe they had not returned all the funds. In fact they had but their "" specialist '' did not do his math calculation correctly. 

Thats right, an employee of a bank did n't add correctly. It gets worse. 

Now, as they send me a new card they stated in their letter that the pin of the card would stay the same. That did not happen. I tried to access my account with the new ATM card and it was denied. I call them up from XXXX and when I get to a person on the phone, probably a call center, the person on the phone informs me that XXXX has been "" blacklisted '' by the United States government. He said that mean while I was living and working in XXXX I would never be able to access the card. I had to leave XXXX for it work. I was shocked because friends who work at the US Embassy and other friends had not heard of this. 

Why have they not heard of it? Because it was n't true!! 

The man straight lied or got misinformed by someone else saying the USG blacklisted XXXX. I called them back after checking the news to make sure I this man was inaccurate in saying that. I request a supervisor this time, someone who works at Regions directly, perhaps the previous man did not. I explain to her the situation and inform her of past information given to me. She apologizes and informs me I have to wait 5-7 business days for a letter that has my new pin # in it. 

So my complaint is based on important facts. Regions employees did not add the math correctly in the XXXX 2017 falsified transactions. Additionally, when it came time for me to access the card and my pin was rejected the person I contacted told me XXXX was "" blacklisted '' by the United States government. That is a total and complete lie given to me about not accessing my money in Regions bank and it was the spread of misinformation which is not only complaint worthy, it is also worthy of legal proceedings against Regional Financial Corporation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS BANK,TN,370XX,,Consent provided,Web,8/15/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2062663

I had some extra money that I chose to pay into mortgage, {$1000.00} dollars. When I transferred it, the money just sat in the mortgage account, but not applied to the principle. About a week later I called them to ask why. They said that it went into a "" suspense '' account because it was n't enough for whole payment. But, they already have whole payments when they pull them out. This was supposed to go to principle. They said they would shift it around, but they did n't do it right. Several hundred dollars off of that XXXX did n't make it into the principle. I called a few days later, and they said they would try everything again. 

I requested an audit on my mortgage from the beginning of the loan, 4 and a half years, to verify that all payments are going where they are supposed to go. They wo n't do that. They only say that they have now "" re-coded '' my loan so that any future extra payments will now go to the principle.

8/26/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"This complaint is a continuation of complaints filed over the last 3 years against Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, and assigners.Please see the history of this complaint to supplement this complaint. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I entered into a modification agreement with Ocwen Loan Servicing , LLC, to modify my monthly loan payments. The result was my mortgage payment was adjusted to {$690.00}, per month. Upon completing the ( XXXX ) trial mortgage payments in XXXX of XXXX, the modification became permanent. However, the very next month, XXXX of XXXX, Ocwen breached the agreement, by increasing the payment. The month after that, XXXX of XXXX, the payment was increased again. The documentation of the modification and increases in payments are stored in the history of my complaint file. ( Please refer to those documents for proof. ) Since the initial breach, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), et al, has won a court order against several mortgage companies, including Ocwen, that mandates these companies are to, among other things, provide modifications that will lower monthly mortgage payments so that consumers can afford to maintain ownership of their homes. Ocwen has been in constant breach of that "" court-order '' as well. 

Today, I am still suffering from the many breaches that Ocwen continues to perpetrate against me, and it has caused me mental anguish ( intentional infliction of emotional distress ), and financial devastation. As of this writing, I have applied for another modification to lower my {$810.00} mortgage payment to a lower amount that would be affordable for a XXXX ( which I am ) person, managing on a XXXX benefit below {$1400.00} per month. However, instead of lowering the payment by : a. reducing the principal, b. approving a HAMP loan under the Making Homes Affordable Program, or c. extending the term by a sufficient amount of years to lower the payment, Ocwen has increased the payment by XXXX dollars ( {$9.00} and change. Please see attached. ) It is clear that Ocwen could have extended the term more, or it would not have extended it the XXXX ( XXXX ) year that it did. This shows a callous disregard for the court-order ( of XXXX ), et al, and me as a consumer, specifically. It 's also a violation of the Truth in Lending Laws:15 U.S.C. 1601-1667f, as amended, et al. 
The result of Ocwen 's reckless disregard for the court, CFPB, and its consumers, is more suffering and distress for me. Therefore, I demand that the CFPB enforce the court order that it won to force these predatory lenders to act responsibly and modify mortgages in such a way that helps, not hurts, their customers!!",,OCWEN LOAN SERVICING LLC,TN,370XX,,Consent provided,Web,8/26/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2083149

9/13/2016,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I have been enrolled with automatic monthly payments with Navient for more than a year, but I began paying extra money towards the principle of my loan beginning XX/XX/2016. When I submitted the payments online I was given the option of either applying the extra payments towards the principle of the loan vs having the next monthly payment due date advanced. I successfully made an extra payment for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2016 using the online system. When I attempted to make an extra payment XX/XX/2016 the website was no longer providing the option of applying the extra amount to principle vs advancing the monthly due date. I went ahead and submitted the payment thinking it would of course go to the principle. The next business day I received an email that the loan company had instead advanced the due date of my next payment. I called them twice XX/XX/XXXX- once to have the payment adjusted and let them know that there was an issue with their website ; another time to let them know that they still had n't repaired the website. They assured me that they would get the info to their IT staff and the problem would be corrected immediately. I again attempted to make an extra payment earlier this week. Again the website was not giving an option as to how the payment should be applied. I called the company as I was trying to make the payment. They said that it may have been difficulties with their new website, so they directed me to a link to their old web address. The option still was not available, though they assured me that it would be applied to principle. While my online account is showing that the payment did post to the principle I still received an email that told me that the next due date had been advanced a month. I had to call again to ensure that they were not advancing the due date, which it appears that it was going to do just that. The representative advised me that the website should allow me to apply the extra payment to principle vs advance the due date. I once again told the representative that the website is no longer giving the option. I advised her that I have spoken with Navient on several occasions in the past month to get this situation remedied. She advised that she will send another message to the IT team.

1/20/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"Well Chase is at it again. 

This relaters to XXXX of my bank accounts. XXXX ending in XXXX, the other in XXXX. 

On Wed XXXX XXXX at approx XXXX in the XXXX I checked my bank account and noticed a pending overdraw in my XXXX account in the amount of {$27.00}. This is despite the fact that I have overdraft protection which should have covered the overdraft. Perhaps since it was a "" pending '' overdraft it had n't kicked in. So TO BE SURE TO AVOID OVERDRAFT OR FEES I got out of bed, put my boots on and walked through the snow to the bank ( at XXXX ) and deposited XXXX dollar to cover the pending overdrawn account. When I got home I checked online and my account was covered, no pending overdraw, no negative. 

My XXXX account was also in the positive. 

So I went to bed sure that I had avoided overdrawing my account. 

When I woke up this morning XXXX XXXX and checked my account online my account XXXX was overdrawn by XXXX which included a late fee. The amounts shown were totally different than they had been the night previous ( ie. the debits were in amounts exceeding what was shown only hours earlier so it was not an accurate reflection of anything in my account ) But even more disturbing, my account ending in XXXX, which only hours earlier was positive with nothing pending, was now overdrawn by {$130.00}. WITH XXXX LATE FEES and balances that bore no resemblance to what my account had shown only hours before. I know as a fact my account was positive only hours before. 



The check for XXXX that had supposedly overdrawn my account on XXXX XXXX had now mysteriously appeared, though I know as a fact that it had not appeared in my account on XXXX XXXX because I was at the atm and online at XXXX on XXXX XXXX checking my account. 

Chase has always had a "" pending '' period during which I could cover a pending debit. Not only did this now happen, but transactions appeared a day later than they HAD SUPPOSEDLY POSTED. This is either a glitch or a purposeful way to cheat people. Either way, it 's wrong. 

My online and atm balances were not accurate and there was simply no way for me to responsibly keep my balance positive.. I WAS AT THE BANK AT XXXX to put money in and check my accounts!!! 

I now have XXXX dollars in unfair fees that clearly I ca n't afford. 

Of course Chase wo n't help. 'All my fault ' is all they say But this was not my fault or fair. Check the records and you will see that the information provided to me about my accounts was not accurate. 

1.My overdraft protection did not work right. 
2. Chase 's online and atm balances were not accurate and did not provide information to me to allowed me to monitor my accounts. In fact they were actually deceptive, hiding a transaction and then showing it a day after it had supposedly posted. 
3. But their fees work just fee ... as always.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,IL,606XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1750679
2/6/2017,Consumer Loan,Installment loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"Not much happened other than the capitalist rise in America! 

Due to divorce I had to file bankruptcy. My credit was great until divorce. The ex was not helping with our debt anymore so I filed for bankruptcy. 

This has begun a long arduous journey of restoring my credit. Because I am post bankruptcy I did not have access to any loans. I got many credit card offers, many of them at the max APR and usually with a $ XXXX $ XXXX+ annual fee, just to have the low balance terrible interest card. 

I did have access to installment loans. Little did I know how terrible they are. I have had XXXX now, maybe XXXX. Each one ends up in a new XXXX towards the end of it 's lifeline. 

The credit system in America needs to be seriously reconsidered. As it stands it is 100 % pro business and NOT pro consumer. When I try to rent a house through a rental agency, they check my credit and I get denied often. I am basically limited to apartments, duplexes, and town homes because my credit score. This is very discriminating. Without knowing why my credit may look the way it does, I am denied access to a home and limited to multi occupant housing like apartments. I am not low income, just low credit score. Where I live, most apartments are for low income. 
When I do manage to find a place that will let me live there I call the utility company to get my services turned on. They check my credit too and based on the score will charge me astronomical deposits. They will base it on credit first, but then say it is based on the the previous occupants average usage. This is garbage. Again, I am discriminated against because of my credit score. My ex wife gets off scotch free. She never had credit. I did. So in divorce I was hit with everything. She did n't need to be part of the bankruptcy because she had no credit. 
When I go to get a new cell phone I have to pay a higher premium because my credit is low. I ca n't buy a phone for a reduced price because I have bad credit. 
This is basically the issue with all industries. Most can discriminate against me based on my credit score, which means I have to pay more than others because I had to file bankruptcy due to a nasty divorce. 
This also forces me to use other means to acquire cash to make big purchases. 
Those other means? Installment loans and payday loans. Some of the worst possible credit decisions you can make. They cost too much and have interest rates as high as 600 %. 
I got an installment loan for XXXX ... I have been paying for about 6 months now and I will still have paid them XXXX by the time I finish. That is n't include what I have paid in 6 months. So I get a small loan to make a purchase like tires for my car, or something else important and I am stuck in a financial XXXX because again, my credit score ca n't even get me a {$500.00} loan to rebuild my credit. 
Banks shun you!

2/10/2017,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I am contacting you today to request a gesture of goodwill. I have several loans with Fedloan. I am currently on an income based repayment plan that does not require me to make a payment. I would like to actually repay my student debt. My education has served me well and because of it I have been presented with an opportunity to purchase an existing and successful franchise. However, the late payments on my student loan account are preventing me from obtaining an approval for the business loan I need to acquire the franchise. 

The late payments reflecting on my account are actually due to miscommunication on both ends. There were periods of time where I requested a deferment or forbearance due to my financial hardships but my requests were not initially honored ( Apparently due to a mistake made by the customer service representative ). In XXXX or XXXX of XXXX my family was struggling to make ends meet and were on public assistance. I communicated this to a representative at the time and they informed me they would request a deferment of my payments for 1 year. I thought my account was squared away and did not check my monthly statements, for a while. 

In the XXXX I received a notification via email that my loan was on the verge of defaulting which prompted me to call. It was then that I was informed that the deferment I requested had not been implemented. The representative was very polite and helped me resolve the issue through backdating the forbearance and deferment request. It was my understanding I would not need another deferment for at least 12 months if my financial situation did not improve. This was not the case and lead to additional late payments on my accounts. 

I take complete responsibility for not following-up and ensuring the initial deferment was implemented and for not understanding that I needed to make another deferment request, however ; I would really like to be in a position to repay my loans in full. The franchise I seek to acquire will allow me to repay all of my student debt within a matter of 36 months. I understand Fedloan is obliged to report payment history accurately. I ask that either Fedloan stop reporting the late information and make it "" unavailable '' or better yet update my payment history to reflect the loans were in forbearance/deferment for the following months XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX of XXXX and XXXX and XXXX of XXXX and mark them as paid as agreed. Doing so will allow me to improve my financial position and repay my loans in full.",,AES/PHEAA,NE,681XX,,Consent provided,Web,2/10/2017,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,2339705

1/17/2017,Credit card,,Closing/Cancelling account,,"I am writing because my Citibank XXXX card account that I have had open for over 16 years was closed without warning and with no opportunity to appeal the decision. It came as a complete surprise when I found that my account had been closed. Calling to try to request reopening the account and to explain what had happened was even more frustrating as there was no real process or means to have my story heard and have the situation rectified. 

About a month ago ( XXXX XXXX ) I got an email from my dad 's secretary that Citibank was trying to reach me and they left a number. I called the number and the person on the phone told me that I should pay approx. {$150.00}. I could not understand why a creditor would be coming after for me for such a small amount so I thought maybe it was some type of scam. ( If you have access to this call, you can listen for yourself ). In order to make sure this was not a scam, I told the person on the phone that I would pay through my online account. Unfortunately, I was locked out of my online account and when I called to get a new password, they told me I needed my debit card. When I gave them my debit card number, they told me it was n't the most recent because citi had sent me another card. I did n't know what they were talking about so I just asked them to send a new card. I 'm sure you can see all of this in my account notes. I never received that debit card and a couple weeks passed before there was another call to my dad 's office. This again was strange that they were not calling my cell phone but an office where I did not even work. I told them I would pay as soon as I received my card and had access to my account. I was not told anything about the possibility of my account being shut down. I also received no emails or online messages that my account would be shut down. I had assumed that my credit card account had been in autopay which it has always been on, but I 'm guessing after a period of dormant activity that the autopay was turned off. Approximately a week later I received my new debit card, logged into my account and paid my balance fully. I then asked if I could speak to someone about having the late fees on my account waived. It was then that they informed me that my account had been shut down and there was no way to reopen it. This is an account that I have had open since XXXX XXXX. There was absolutely no one to look into reopening to my account and no investigation as to why it had been closed. Whomever I was speaking to on the phone ( wherever they were located in the world ) did not have enough communication skills to warn me about my account closing and tell me what was actually happening and came across instead as someone trying to perpetrate a fraud against my account. Now because I was trying to be safe with my money and because Citibank could not effectively warn me that my account would be closed, I will have a HUGE ding to my credit score and no opportunity to explain or rectify this situation through a process. 

As further proof that I was not sufficiently warned, I received the email ( see below ) on XXXX XXXX from Citibank letting me know my monthly statement was available. It said nothing about shutting down an account. There was a Statement summary with a statement date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The statement balance was {$990.00}. The minimum payment due was {$200.00}. The Payment due date was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I paid off the full balance on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. So why was my account closed? You can also see why I would be in no rush to pay off my balance to someone over the phone when I received an email like this.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",NY,100XX,,Consent provided,Web,1/17/2017,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2291415

The time spent in resolving so many issues over so many years is time I will never get back, nor will be compensated for.

7/24/2015,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"Navient has taken unauthorized debits from my checking account XXXX during the month of XXXX, 2015. They took unauthorized debits once on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 for {$110.00}, and most recently on XXXX XXXX, 2015 for {$390.00}. 
On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015, I discovered that Navient had automatically debited my XXXX checking account for {$110.00} for the student loan ending in XXXX. I had not authorized this transaction or set it up. My father makes an automatic payment for the loan ending in XXXX, and had given Navient HIS account information for the automatic payment. I had set up automatic payments for about {$390.00} for the rest of my private loans, and my payment was not scheduled to come out until XXXX XXXX. I called Navient to demand that my {$110.00} be credited back to my XXXX account, and that they take the payment from my father 's account instead. 
Navient incorrectly stated that I had enrolled all of my loans into auto-payment on XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$500.00}, and that they only had my XXXX information for the payments. That was false. I had only set up the {$390.00} payment recently, and my father set up the {$110.00} payment with his bank information. Ultimately, Navient agreed to do a direct refund to my XXXX checking account for the {$110.00}. They also agreed to cancel all auto-payments. My father was supposed to call back and set up his auto-payment for {$110.00} at a later date in XXXX, and I was going to call back and set up my auto-payment for the {$390.00} at a later date in XXXX. I was supposed to have my refund of {$110.00} by XXXX XXXX at the latest. 
My father called Navient back between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to re-establish his auto-payment for {$110.00}. His next payment is due XXXX XXXX, 2015. I had not called back to re-establish my auto-payment for {$390.00} as of XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I logged into my XXXX checking account again to check my balance. I was alarmed to see that Navient had again taken an unauthorized automatic payment from my checking account! I had not called back to re-establish my auto-payment, but Navient had debited {$390.00} from my checking account. It was taken in XXXX unauthorized transactions ( {$120.00} ; {$100.00} ; {$71.00} ; {$93.00} ). This is especially egregious that Navient took these unauthorized payments despite agreeing on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that it would cancel all auto-payments and to wait until we called back to re-establish them. 
I am going to call Navient now to demand a direct refund. My funds are rather limited at this time, and I am unable to allow Navient to invade my checking account and debit funds at will without my authorization.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,223XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/24/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1485245

10/9/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"In XXXX XXXX I ended a lease with XXXX XXXX and purchased the vehicle with a loan from Chase Auto Finance. At the time I was living in XXXX, and in XXXX of XXXX we moved back to XXXX. Once I moved I started getting documents from Chase, sent in XXXX overnight envelopes, stating that I owed over {$2000.00} in DMV fees to XXXX, with no real explanation as to why. 
After months of repeated attempts to contact Chase to get answers, I sent a letter in XXXX XXXX stating I needed a clear timeline and schedule of events, assessments, and payments so I can clearly understand what they were stating I owed and why. I stated that if I did not receive a resolution I would be forced to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to review the situation. 
Once I sent my letter the case was escalated to a manager within Chase, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX promptly called me and stated the previous Customer Service agent made some mistakes and that Chase would cover the balance owed and she would personally support the case. I thought everything was handled until I received a packet from the XXXX DMV stating that they were sent an incomplete application and the title "" needs a company stamp or name with counter signature on section XXXX of the certificate of title ''. 

Not knowing what this means or what to do, I called XXXX XXXX four times over 2 months, each timing leaving her a detailed voicemail, with no response. I called Customer Service multiple times and they were friendly, but unable to understand the issue or what to do. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I spoke with a customer service agent who was able to reach XXXX XXXX via internal Instant Messaging while I was on the phone, and XXXX XXXX still refused to take my call. But she did agree to let me email her the information I received from the XXXX DMV. 

After reviewing the information, XXXX XXXX emailed me to say this needed to go to XXXX XXXX for a signature. I emailed her multiple times, we spoke on the phone, and I made it very clear that Chase needed to tell me WHO at XXXX could help ( I did n't want to send it to a generic address where their Customer Service team would n't know what to do with it either ). I still did not understand why Chase did n't handle this back in XXXX XXXX, and XXXX stated she did n't know why either, but that I needed to send it to XXXX. 
Unfortunately she sent me a XXXX envelope with a generic address to XXXX Financing, and when I sent them my title packet from the XXXX DMV with a letter explaining that I needed their signature, they sent it back to me unchanged with no letter of explanation. 

At this point I have had a loan with Chase for 16 months and still no operating title, which is a huge issue. It is imperative for Chase, the state of XXXX, and myself to have a proper title. It also seems clear that Chase will only communicate with me seriously on this matter if I threaten to escalate to you, the CFPB. That however, has also stopped working, which is why I 'm now filing this complaint.

6/30/2015,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"XX/XX/XXXX, I secured a mortgage with Bank of America ( FHA Home Loan ) as a first-time homebuyer. At the time I was offered free "" debt protection '' for 1 year ; in the event I could not make a monthly payment on time, debt protection may apply. It was not clearly explained to me what this did and did not cover, but I was advised to accept it due to its free nature. In XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that I had been enrolled beyond the 1-year mark and was being charged a monthly fee via my escrow account. No communication had been made to me that I was auto-enrolled beyond the free "" trial '' period. I had been billed for an extended period without my knowledge. Further, I also encountered difficulty paying my monthly installment around the same period ( I was a full-time student prohibited from working and thus relying on savings and grants ). Realizing that I had "" coverage '' without having known, I called customer service to request the debt protection and allow me some time to pay the installments without penalty. I was advised that debt protection did not apply to this scenario, only a select few ( that were likely not to happen ). 

As a consumer, the debt protection offering was presented in a way that favored BofA, and not me. My savings, credit, employment history were scrutinized very closely and thus it was fairly clear I was not going to need protection during the free 1-year period. Further, it is very unlikely a consumer will remember they opted for a free service, gone unused, after a full year. 

The result is that BofA made over {$1000.00} off me, without providing any benefit and knowing the likelihood of having it 's services used under its narrow parameters was marginal.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MD,208XX,,Consent provided,Web,6/30/2015,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,Yes,1444176

10/26/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Specialized Loan Services LLC. Before payments began I spoke to SLS and they agreed, via phone, that I could continue to pay bi-weekly like I had been doing with XXXX XXXX XXXX. They stated that their system was not set up for it but they would do it. The statements sent out were going to be off and show late fees however they said not to worry about it because they would have it corrected in the system. Once in a while they would call to say it was late however when I mentioned the agreement the caller would see it written in the system and have the calls stopped. I set up bill pay with my bank so that the day after my paycheck was deposited a check would be sent out to SLS. I have never missed one payment, and there have been months when they have received an extra payment. From XX/XX/XXXX till about I believe XX/XX/XXXX there were no late charges and I believe ( I have no way of checking ) they were even applying the extra money to the principal. However after doing my XX/XX/XXXX taxes I found that around XX/XX/XXXX they had started to charge late fees and were no longer applying the extra money to the principal. I had also found where they were reporting me late, over 19 times, to the credit report companies. When I tried to dispute it SLS would send a copy of the original agreement I made with the private lender saying I agreed to a single payment once a month, and that they were only a third party attempting to collect a debt. I explained to them that they agreed to the new payments in XX/XX/XXXX and that even though it was verbal they had to honor it. They refuse to correct any of the late charges, or late reportings. The one customer service rep. I talked to said there was no way to really prove there was an agreement. I did tell him that the fact it took them a year and half to start charging late fees, and that I have been paying the same exact way since XX/XX/XXXX should be pretty easy to prove it. He than said well we are only a third party trying to collect a debt which is not true either. The private lender died and his next of kin sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have checked and XXXX XXXX XXXX have the account showing as closed out saying they sold it SLS. When I asked for a supervisor he advised there was no way of reaching one and hung up. I have filed complaints with XXXX, as well as with the XXXX in an attempt to clear this up however they will not honor the verbal agreement we made.

5/23/2016,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"Dear CFPB, This is my second complaint on your board and I hope you do receive and read this. I am a former student of XXXX XXXX -- XXXX. Recently my federal loans have been thankfully forgiven and takes a very heavy burden off my shoulders. I have no problem paying for student loans as long as I did learn something from the time and also possibly a new skill to use in the world. 

However, the Corinthian system and also it 's private lending program has been found to be deceptive in their practices, and the law of the universe is that truth always comes out, one way or another. In my own experience, I have no problems with the teachers nor education in my campus, I did learn and everyone was always very kind to me. That however is the most I can say. 


Since attending this school, I have been forced to take out overpriced amounts from the government and to add to that an additional loan from private programs. The money that was promised to be by my Financial Aid advisor I have never seen even after almost 2 years of school. 

The private student loans I took out I immediately had to pay before I began my classes. The difficulty in your first month and already paying for a loan for me was difficult as I only maintained a part time job aside from taking care of filial duties with my family at home. My sister was kind enough to pay for this loan off the bat. I have paid this private loan off recently XX/XX/XXXX whilst XXXX was still coming under fire. 

I have recently asked for a reimbursement from Campus Student Funding LLC for monies paid -- they declined. This is money that I should not have paid for from the beginning. I quote XXXX stating that "" paying for these loans from the beginning teaches students about financial obligations and responsibility ''. After what XXXX was found for, that quote is the most heinous, greedy and almost evil statement due to what the hidden motives of the school were. 


I 'm complaining about XXXX -- Campus Student Funding LLC. They have worked with Corinthian in scamming students into high priced extra loans that were used as a mere gambling scheme to fill their pockets, defraud other individuals, and play with lives of already financially struggling individuals by forming a plan to suck the money right out of their pockets and be used as a trading and bargaining tool for profit. 

XXXX - CSF LLC has several class action lawsuits vs them and their affiliates for defrauding investors of the company, and have been found that XXXX was one of their biggest profit makers, through deceptive agreements with the college behind officials and students for mass profit. 

XXXX CEO 's have now stepped down amidst the fire and a court appointed receiver is now in charge of liquidating assets. This is the time to make a move for the people and students and finally close the chapter for financial burden in this "" XXXX private student loan program ''. 

I am looking for a settlement of the money I paid only in principle which is {$2700.00} not including interest ( 8 % ). With the truth out about this XXXX partner in crime, I believe it is fair for the receiver to forgive student loans owed and to reimburse the students of money paid already. 

I have included court documents, local Oregon news articles that have tied this scheme with XXXX from the beginning but now have just been found and their time is up. As I said in life, the constant is truth, and I believe this can be a close to the XXXX tragedy of high tuition loans and deceiving students. 

Though I will return to school, for profit colleges and institutions from now on will be vigilant in their main cause of existence, which is helping others before helping themselves. 


I would like a response about a reimbursement and relief and CFPB a response about their current standing with this company.",,"Campus Student Funding, LLC",CA,941XX,,Consent provided,Web,5/23/2016,Closed with non-monetary relief,No,Yes,1937956

There was no help, all they kept telling me was that there was nothing they could do.

The calls and lack of options significantly added to my XXXX levels. I have complained repeatedly that my balance never seems to go down even though I continued to make payments.

10/29/2016,Credit card,,Application processing delay,,"I held the Wachovia Platinum Visa card for several years before mismanagement drove it to insolvency and the FDIC arranged its acquisition by Wells Fargo. A short while after I opened the card, Wachovia introduced a rewards program. Adding it to my account involved a simple change of account setting through my online profile. I did not have to apply for a new card. When Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia, it discontinued the rewards program without notice or explanation. A few months later, when I attempted to redeem the rewards which I thought had continued to accrue, I learned of the ending of the rewards program. Being aware that Wells Fargo had its own rewards Visa card, I visited my local branch to inquire. I was shocked to learn that Wells Fargo demanded that I apply for a new card event though they themselves had removed the rewards program which I had previously. 

When the acquisition originally was announced, Wells Fargo assured its customers that we would continue to receive the excellent service which we enjoyed under Wachovia. Shocked that Wells Fargo expected me to apply for a new card in order to restore the ability to earn rewards, I opted instead to desist in using the card, demoting it to use only in case of emergency. 

The card languished in this state for approximately 5 years. Then, earlier in 2016, I visited the same branch on other business and was informed by the teller that I was eligible for rewards on the same card. He encouraged me to accept the new program as the enrollment process was simple. Astonished, I immediately visited a customer service representative who explained that, yes, I could have THE SAME REWARDS PROGRAM which I originally had with Wachovia without applying for a new card. I merely had to consent to a change of setting on my card, which the representative conducted with my consent. 

A few weeks later, when my card expired and I received my automatic renewal, the new card clearly indicated its status as a rewards card. I felt a great sense of irony that the senior leadership of Wells Fargo needed 5 years to realize that the Wachovia program never should have been cancelled but accepted this new reality. 

My relief was short-lived when I learned that Wells Fargo had encouraged me to accept the new rewards program so that I would be confused and erroneously conclude that the newer, more, Cash Wise program was the same program as I had just accepted. Once I realized the deception, I examined the product 's terms and conditions on wf.com which made it clear that it was a separate product requiring an application. I applied and was denied. 

Concluding that an error had been made, I rang the reconsideration line and explained that I did not desire an additional credit line but rather a change in product. The operator suggested that I ask the Credit Card Services department for a product swap, which I would have done originally had I believed it to be an option. The Credit Card Services department denied my request because, under the bizarre manner in which the bank 's systems are programmed, it was a duplicate application, even though, supposedly, a product swap is not an application and would have retained the same credit line. 

As a final effort, I decided to visit the same branch which had encouraged me to accept the lesser rewards program. Before doing so, however, I applied for a credit line increase on my XXXX XXXX card, which was approved, clearly signaling that my creditworthiness was not at issue. 

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for so long that, when I opened my original account, it was with XXXX XXXX. The loyalty which I have demonstrated has been reciprocated with deliberate deception and profiteering because Wells Fargo seeks to minimize enrollments in its best rewards program in order to pad its profit margin.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL,328XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/29/2016,Closed with explanation,No,Yes,2185350

I explained to the Rep I used XXXX points which is equivalent to {$25.00} plus I mailed in the remaining balance of {$16.00}, which equal a total amount of {$41.00}, the minimum balance owed. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 the Rep for Barclay Credit Card stated the XXXX points, which equal to {$25.00} are not allowed/ can not be used to pay toward minimum balance owed. I explained to the Rep I inquired/ask a Customers Service Rep on XXXX XXXX, 2015 about my rewards points and can I use them to pay on my minimum balance owed? The Rep Stated Yes and further stated the XXXX reward points= {$25.00} will be applied to the minimum balance and I must send in the remaining balance of {$16.00} before XXXX XXXX,2015. A Rep on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 stated the Representative on XXXX XXXX,2015 gave me incorrect information. I stated to the Rep on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 the information I received from the Customer Service Rep on XXXX XXXX, 2015 I relied upon and made a decision base on that information to use my rewards point toward my minimum payment owed. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 I requested the Rep to listen to the recording of the Rep and myself on XXXX XXXX, 2015. 
The Rep contacted me after inquiring about the recording of XXXX XXXX, 2015 and stated Barclay Credit Card will waive any and all late fees due to the incorrect information I received by the Customer Service Rep, but requested the {$25.00} because reward points are not allowed for payment, which I sent.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I contacted Barclay Card about the declined and the increase in my minimum balance of {$78.00}.

On or about XXXX XXXX, 2015 a Barclay Customers Service Rep contacted me about the increase in the minimum amount due of {$78.00}. She stated something in regard to the increase, but it was not clear me the reason for the increase of the minimum balance. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I attempted to make a purchase at XXXX in the amount of {$20.00}, which was declined. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I contacted Barclay Customer Service about the purchase being declined. The customer service rep stated as a result of the late payment of {$25.00} these issues are present until I make a payment of about {$1.00}. The Issues are, increase in minimum amount due, no cash advance, and decline of purchases. I relied upon information from Barclay Rep, I could use my reward points to pay toward my minimum balance, as a result of the incorrect information from Barclay Rep my minimum balance owed has increased, I ca n't get cash advance, and making a purchases using my Barclay Card are being declined.

When I applied everything went without a hitch, and I was approved instantly as I have an excellent credit rating. But when I tried to activate the card, the card was "" frozen '' for fraud alert -- I 'm not sure why that was the case since nobody from Capital One bothered to tell me despite my numerous requests -- and Capital One asked for my ID, SSN card and some kind of statements, etc. to prove that I 'm who I am. I was advised that it 'd take XXXX business hours. 

It 's been more than three business days. Nobody has any answers for me. XXXX of the reps promised to call me with an update, but they never did. I presume they have the recording of our calls. Their online help on XXXX is also unhelpful. 

If Capital One was worried about my identity, it should 've asked me to submit all the documents, etc. when I applied, NOT after I already got the card. Furthermore, I detest the way the representatives from Capital One would n't tell me anything, treating me like I 'm a scammer, despite the fact that I had to verify my date of birth, SSN and other information provided at the time of application. According to them, scammers know a lot of information about their victims. If so, they did they accept my application and approve it? 

I 'm currently overseas right now. I was hoping to be able to use the card and take advantage of no foreign transaction fee, but apparently that 's not going to happen.

A second company called JH Portfolio Debt Equities stipulates that they purchased the debt from XXXX at the same time. They like XXXX can not enforce a debt that is considered non-collectible. So, if the debt is simply too old to collect, and the fact that JH Portfolio Debt Equities can not collect, they sent the collection to a new collection agency called XXXX. This is the third collection agency that simply has no recourse to collect on an antiquated debt. XXXX shows no proof of ownership or collection proxy, then why is the very same account remaining on my credit report from any collection agency. This is an example where a collection agency is using my personal credit rating as hostage to collect on an old account that has already been removed from my credit reports by the original creditor, XXXX These collection processes are highly scrutinized by the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It is a re-aging process on debts that have long outlived their usefulness to be maintained on credit. These collection processes are the main reason why even the FTC considers the national collection process broken. I know that the CFPB and its Director XXXX are before Congress currently on the usefulness of the CFPB, and I make the claim that it is the best recourse that an American consumer must fight the corruption that exist in the debt collection process by thousands of collection agencies that could care less about my constitutional and civil rights.

11/18/2015,Debt collection,I do not know,Improper contact or sharing of info,Contacted me after I asked not to,"Improper contact or sharing of information probably best describes what happened. 

I received a call asking for someone who is n't me. I let them know I was not who they were looking for, but I wanted to know how my phone number was on their call list. 

The only response I received was : I 'm sorry, we must have the wrong phone number. To which, I asked, how exactly did my number end up in your system. 

I was escalated to a manager, and again, the only response I received was that if it was a wrong number, they will mark it as such. But they had no explanation for how they received my number. 

The manager tried to feed me some XXXX by telling me that it 's probably just a leftover reference from the old owner of my phone number. I informed him that I 've had my phone number for over a decade, which should put the debt they are trying to recover for beyond the statute of limitations in most states in the US. 

The manager offered to pull up the record and saw that the first time I was called was in XXXX 2015. That pretty much exposes the flimsy explanation the manager provided me in the beginning. 

In addition, a cursory google search shows that Portfolio Recovery Associates has been guilty ( and fined for ) of attempts at recovering debts beyond the statute of limitations in NY. 

I am writing this complaint to say that it looks like Portfolio Recovery Associates may not have changed their behavior and are likely continuing to try and recover debts outside of the legal limits. 

I do not feel their tactics are honest, and I am further in support of reform of the debt recovery industry. People should, without a doubt, pay their debts, but debt recovery agencies need to be held to greater accountability.",,PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES INC,CA,947XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/18/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1660592
